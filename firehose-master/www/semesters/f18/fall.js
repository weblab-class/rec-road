Seminars are followed by one-on-one discussion with instructor to connect the clinical experience with parallel course material on the neurobiology of disease.","rr":[],"f":false,"la":false,"no":"9.900","u1":0,"l":[],"u3":0,"u2":1,"nx":false,"re":false,"s":[],"r":[],"lr":[],"t":["FA","JA","SP"],"h":0,"si":0,"u":"","sa":"","tb":true,"pl":false,"ra":0},"15.S70":{"ci":false,"co":"15","cl":"S70","hs":false,"hh":false,"le":"G","br":[],"n":"Special Seminar in Management","mw":"","ha":false,"cw":false,"he":false,"pr":"Permission of instructor","b":[],"rp":true,"d":"Group study of current topics related to management not otherwise included in curriculum.","rr":[],"f":false,"la":false,"no":"15.S70","u1":0,"l":[],"u3":0,"u2":0,"nx":false,"re":false,"s":[],"r":[],"lr":[],"t":["FA","JA","SP"],"h":6.5,"si":14.0,"u":"","sa":"","tb":true,"pl":false,"ra":6.3},"15.S71":{"ci":false,"co":"15","cl":"S71","hs":false,"hh":false,"le":"G","br":[],"n":"Special Seminar in Management","mw":"","ha":false,"cw":false,"he":false,"pr":"Permission of instructor","b":[],"rp":true,"d":"Group study of current topics related to management not otherwise included in curriculum.","rr":[],"f":false,"la":false,"no":"15.S71","u1":0,"l":[[[[106,6]],"E51-376"]],"u3":0,"u2":0,"nx":false,"re":false,"s":["l"],"r":[],"lr":["R EVE (4-7 PM)"],"t":["FA","JA","SP"],"h":5.8,"si":28.0,"u":"","sa":"","tb":false,"pl":false,"ra":6.0},"15.S72":{"ci":false,"co":"15","cl":"S72","hs":false,"hh":false,"le":"G","br":[],"n":"Special Seminar in Management","mw":"","ha":false,"cw":false,"he":false,"pr":"Permission of instructor","b":[],"rp":true,"d":"Group study of current topics related to management not otherwise included in curriculum.","rr":[],"f":false,"la":false,"no":"15.S72","u1":0,"l":[],"u3":0,"u2":0,"nx":false,"re":false,"s":[],"r":[],"lr":[],"t":["FA","JA","SP"],"h":7.4,"si":34.0,"u":"","sa":"","tb":true,"pl":false,"ra":5.2},"15.S73":{"ci":false,"co":"15","cl":"S73","hs":false,"hh":false,"le":"G","br":[],"n":"Special Seminar in Management","mw":"","ha":false,"cw":false,"he":false,"pr":"Permission of instructor","b":[],"rp":true,"d":"Group study of current topics related to management not otherwise included in curriculum.","rr":[],"f":false,"la":false,"no":"15.S73","u1":0,"l":[],"u3":0,"u2":0,"nx":false,"re":false,"s":[],"r":[],"lr":[],"t":["FA","JA","SP"],"h":3.4,"si":17.0,"u":"","sa":"","tb":true,"pl":false,"ra":5.5},"15.S74":{"ci":false,"co":"15","cl":"S74","hs":false,"hh":false,"le":"G","br":[],"n":"Special Seminar in Management","mw":"","ha":false,"cw":false,"he":false,"pr":"Permission of instructor","b":[],"rp":true,"d":"Group study of current topics related to management not otherwise included in curriculum.","rr":[],"f":false,"la":false,"no":"15.S74","u1":0,"l":[],"u3":0,"u2":0,"nx":false,"re":false,"s":[],"r":[],"lr":[],"t":["FA","JA","SP"],"h":6.1,"si":51.0,"u":"","sa":"","tb":true,"pl":false,"ra":5.6},"15.S75":{"ci":false,"co":"15","cl":"S75","hs":false,"hh":false,"le":"G","br":[],"n":"Special Seminar in Management","mw":"","ha":false,"cw":false,"he":false,"pr":"Permission of instructor","b":[],"rp":true,"d":"Group study of current topics related to management not otherwise included in curriculum.","rr":[],"f":false,"la":false,"no":"15.S75","u1":0,"l":[],"u3":0,"u2":0,"nx":false,"re":false,"s":[],"r":[],"lr":[],"t":["FA","JA","SP"],"h":7.5,"si":5.0,"u":"","sa":"","tb":true,"pl":false,"ra":7.0},"6.589":{"ci":false,"co":"6","cl":"589","hs":false,"hh":false,"le":"G","br":[],"n":"Principles of Synthetic Biology","mw":"6.580, 20.305","ha":false,"cw":false,"he":false,"pr":"None","b":[],"rp":false,"d":"Introduces the basics of synthetic biology, including quantitative cellular network characterization and modeling.

After the initial meetings, students are encouraged to take more responsibility and to lead the group in problem-solving sessions. Each study group meets for a minimum of three hours each week. The meeting time is set by the XL facilitator based on students' schedules.","rr":[],"f":false,"la":false,"no":"SP.110","u1":0,"l":[],"u3":0,"u2":0,"nx":false,"re":false,"s":[],"r":[],"lr":[],"t":["FA"],"h":0,"si":0,"u":"","sa":"","tb":true,"pl":false,"ra":0},"16.71":{"ci":false,"co":"16","cl":"71","hs":false,"hh":false,"le":"G","br":[],"n":"The Airline Industry","mw":"","ha":false,"cw":false,"he":false,"pr":"None","b":[],"rp":false,"d":"Overview of the global airline industry, focusing on recent industry performance, current issues and challenges for the future.

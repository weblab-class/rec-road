# Stuff to Implement
1. Scrape course descriptions, ratings, and pictures from Student Catalog, FireHose, and OCW
2. Search bar
3. Upgrade feed recommending algorithm
4. Profile page
5. History page to store and display past votes
6. Sidebar with settings that are saved after each session
7. Pre-choose classes
8. Login with Touchstone/Integration with Canvas (not sure if these will be the same system/can students login to our website without connecting to Canvas?)
9. Export to FireRoad
10. Friend page/system
11. Implement prereq box/algorithm in results
12. Implement OCW links/box in results
13. A few more stylistic choices
